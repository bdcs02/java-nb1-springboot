                    <h3>History of the Hungarian Football Championship</h3>
                    <p>The Hungarian championship is one of the oldest football leagues in Europe with a rich tradition. The first league was organized in 1901 by the MLSZ (Hungarian Football Federation, now the Hungarian Football Association), which was founded in January 1901 to bring together teams that had only been playing sporadically until then. Among these teams, you can find many clubs that are still active participants in the league today, as well as some whose names now only mean something to the most passionate football fans.</p>
